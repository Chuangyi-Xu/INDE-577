    "# Community Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defination\n",
    "\n",
    "Community detection is a fundamental task in network analysis that aims to identify groups of nodes (communities) that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world systems—such as social networks, communication networks, and biological networks—nodes naturally form clusters based on shared characteristics or interactions. Detecting these communities helps reveal the underlying structure and organization of complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying social groups in online social networks\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Discovering functional modules in biological networks\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Analyzing information flow in communication networks\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "A network is commonly represented as a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large G = (V, E)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\large V$ is the set of nodes (e.g., users),\n",
    "    \n",
    "- $\\large E$ is the set of edges representing relationships between nodes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the network is modeled as an **undirected graph**, where an edge indicates a mutual relationship between two entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Girvan–Newman Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Girvan–Newman algorithm** is a classic **divisive community detection** method based on the concept of **edge betweenness centrality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge betweenness measures how often an edge lies on the shortest paths between pairs of nodes.  \n",
    "Edges with high betweenness typically act as “bridges” between communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the betweenness of an edge eee is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large C_B(e) = \\sum_{s \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(e)}{\\sigma_{st}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\large \\sigma_{st}​$ is the total number of shortest paths between nodes sss and ttt,\n",
    "    \n",
    "- $\\large \\sigma_{st}(e)$ is the number of those paths that pass through edge eee.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Girvan–Newman algorithm follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute edge betweenness centrality for all edges in the graph\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Remove the edge with the highest betweenness\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Recompute betweenness on the updated graph\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Repeat until the network splits into multiple connected components\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Each connected component obtained during this process represents a potential community.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modularity-Based Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the most meaningful community structure, **modularity** is often used as a quality measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity compares the density of edges inside communities with what would be expected in a random graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i,j} \\left[ A_{ij} - \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \\right] \\mathbb{I}(c_i = c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\large A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix,\n",
    "    \n",
    "- $\\large k_i$​ and $\\large k_j$​ are node degrees,\n",
    "    \n",
    "- $\\large m$ is the total number of edges,\n",
    "    \n",
    "- $\\large \\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is an indicator function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Higher modularity values indicate stronger community structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the partition with the **highest modularity** during the edge removal process is selected as the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning**: no labels are required\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Graph-based method**: operates directly on network structure\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Interpretable**: community boundaries correspond to removed “bridge” edges\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Computationally intensive**: suitable for small to medium-sized graphs"

    "\n",
    "Although the dataset is not originally provided as a network, it can be naturally transformed into a graph structure by defining relationships between influencers based on shared attributes. This makes it suitable for demonstrating **community detection algorithms** in a realistic setting. We first load the dataset and inspect its basic structure."

    "> The results show that influencers are grouped into communities largely aligned with geographic regions. Influencers from countries with many representatives form large, dense communities, while countries with fewer influencers form smaller communities. Influencers whose country appears only once in the dataset are treated as isolated nodes and are not assigned to any community.\n",
